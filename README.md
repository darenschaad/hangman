#Hangman

###By: Daren Schaad

##Description

Hangman is an application I worked on in my intro to programming class at Epicodus.  It shows a basic proficiency in Javascript, jQuery, git, Markdown, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and Behavior Driven Development. A user can make a guess by clicking on a letter and if the letter is in the word it shows up, if not the hangman gets another part drawn on the screen.
